# Elastic_Net
Machine learning model using elastic-net regression.

## Introduction
This is a script designed to train a model based on building layout data, but it could be adapted to other use cases. The trainning data was a combination of quantitative data from the layouts, and data from surveys of people ranking the actual layouts which served as the labels for the model.

## Prerequisites
This project requires Python3 setup. The best way to run is in Jupyter Notebook.
